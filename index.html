            <p>My girlfriend and I recently took a vacation to Los Angles, California to visit family. I have already been to California many times when I was younger. Now that I am all grown up, I get to go where I want to go.  We had an extra day, so we decided to go visit a national park in the heart of California. Sequioa National Park is where nature's ancient wonders stood tall and proud. The prospect of walking amidst the colossal trees and exploring the beauty filled us with excitement. However, it was an 8-hour drive from LA to the park. We left early in the morning and once we finally got there. It was tiring because we also had to wait an hour to get in the park since everyone went too but it was worth it. Hiking along the well-marked paths, I marveled at the enormity of the trees. I reached out and touched the rough bark, feeling a connection to the past and an appreciation for nature's enduring strength. I was able to take the picture standing on a huge boulder and I am now in love with the picture for a lifetime.</p>

            <p>The picture on the right is my 2022 Kawaski Ninja 650 KRT edition. I bought this for the price of $7500 brand new with only 1 mile on it. I also added a $900 Yoshimura Race Alpha Stainless Full Exhaust with Carbon Fiber Muffler. Green has been my favorite color since I was a kid. I got this when I turned 18. I added a bunch of racing stickers on to my bike to make it look super sporty. Sadly, I only time my bike out occasionally to go somewhere short or to work. The picture on the left is my 2019 Honda Civic Sport. I bought this brand new when I was 16 years old for the price of $23000. This is my first real achievement as a young adult. I worked long hours as a minor illegally under the table. I would like to say that I still own it and it has been such a great investment for me.</p>
